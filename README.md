## Component Structure and Design Decisions

### Architecture Overview

The application follows a role-based architecture with a clear separation of concerns:

1. **Authentication Layer**
   - Centralized login component that handles user authentication
   - Role-based routing that directs users to appropriate dashboards

2. **State Management**
   - React Context API for global state management
   - localStorage for data persistence across sessions
   - Mock data initialization for demonstration purposes

3. **Component Organization**
   - Role-specific component folders (Admin, Student, Login)
   - Reusable UI components (Navigation, Animation utilities)
   - Modular design for easy maintenance and scalability

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Role-Based Access Control**
   - Implementation of conditional rendering based on user roles
   - Separate dashboards for students and professors with tailored functionality

2. **Data Persistence**
   - localStorage implementation for mock data persistence
   - Automatic cleanup of orphaned submissions
   - Data initialization with sample assignments and users

3. **UI/UX Enhancements**
   - Custom animation components for interactive user experience
   - Scroll-based animations for smooth content transitions
   - Interactive background elements for visual appeal
   - Responsive design for cross-device compatibility

4. **Component Design Patterns**
   - Reusable card components for consistent data display
   - Modal patterns for creation flows
   - Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
   - Progress visualization components

### Technical Stack

- **Core Technologies**
  - React 19.1.1: Frontend library for building user interfaces
  - TypeScript ~5.9.3: Typed superset of JavaScript for enhanced development experience
  - Vite 7.1.7: Fast build tool and development server

- **UI Libraries and Styling**
  - Tailwind CSS 4.1.16: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
  - Lucide React 0.548.0: Icon library with consistent, scalable vector icons
  - GSAP 3.13.0: Animation library for creating high-performance animations

- **State Management**
  - React Context API: Built-in state management solution for sharing data across components
  - LocalStorage: Client-side data persistence for mock assignment system

- **Development Tools**
  - ESLint 9.36.0: Code quality and consistency enforcement
  - PostCSS 8.5.6: CSS processing and transformation tool
  - Autoprefixer 10.4.21: Vendor prefixing for cross-browser compatibility

### Key Features

- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface using Tailwind's responsive utilities
- **Interactive Animations**: Custom GSAP-based animations for enhanced UX
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Different views and permissions for students vs. professors
- **Persistent Data Storage**: Mock data system using localStorage
